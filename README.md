## üìå Instructions
This repository contains solutions for **Lab 2: Core Programming Concepts for C++/Java**.  
I have chosen **C++** (`main.cpp`) as the implementation language.

## üìù Contents
The file is structured into sections as in the lab handout:

1. Main Function  
2. Variables  
3. Control Flow  
4. Functions / Methods  
5. Comments  
6. Classes  
7. Enums  
8. Inheritance  
9. Mixins & Interfaces  
10. Polymorphism  
11. Async Operations  
12. Exceptions  

Each section contains **coding tasks** (in C++) and **theoretical answers** as comments.
